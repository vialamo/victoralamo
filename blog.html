      <h1>Tales of the score</h1>
      <p style="font-family:arial;font-size: 1.0rem">September 7, 2025</p>
      <p>From time to time I write. Here is <em>Tales of the score</em>, a collection of three short stories.</p>
      <h2>Wake up</h2>
      <p>Slowly, he woke up. He felt numb and disoriented, unable to remember anything, who he was, or where.</p>
      <p>It was dark. He couldn’t tell if his eyes were open.  He made a vague attempt to move, but he couldn’t–he was trapped somewhere.</p>
      <p>Clumsily, he felt around. He was enclosed in a wooden box, about the size of his body, without any opening. There was nothing there but himself.</p>
      <p>He had no memories to make sense of the situation.</p>
      <p>He tried pushing against the lid. The wood didn’t budge, not even a little. He attempted calling for help. But his voice wouldn’t come out. He was too weak.</p>
      <p>He finally resigned himself to staying there, which, in his condition, didn't feel so wrong. It was waking up that seemed like a mistake.</p>
      <p>After a long while, he heard something. He breathed more quietly and listened carefully.</p>
      <p>In the beginning, there was nothing. Then, a few faint notes. It was orchestral music, muffled, as if the box were buried deep beneath it.</p>
      <p>Soon, he realized the piece was familiar. He focused on it.</p>
      <p>In his mind, it blossomed. He could see all sorts of details, as if he knew every single note. It was sublime music. Crafted with the finest care. Vivid at times, subtle and delicate at others. Yet, humble and grateful, it exuded effortless simplicity. A masterpiece.</p>
      <p>He writhed in pleasure the whole performance. Then, it ended.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, he would have no choice but to remain there, in a box, not knowing who he was. And yet, he didn’t regret it.</p>
      <h2>The concerto</h2>
      <p>Anton was a successful and acclaimed pianist composer. Recently, he’d been working obsessively on an important commission–a piano concerto. He had isolated himself, leaving home only occasionally to take out the trash—late at night and less often than he should.</p>
      <p>Extremely perfectionist, he wouldn’t stand it if the concerto wasn’t an absolute success. He had put himself under unbearable pressure and wrote every note as if his entire reputation depended on it.</p>
      <p>The countdown was tight. The concerto had to be ready for the rehearsals with the First Symphonic Orchestra and he had to prepare to perform the piano part in the premiere. Nevertheless, thanks to or despite the unhealthy dedication, the progress was good.</p>
      <p>From time to time, he received phone calls from the commissioners or the orchestra staff. He would pick up just a few of these.</p>
      <p>“Anton? It’s Herberg.”<br>“Hi Herberg, how are you?”<br>“Fine, thanks. I’ve been trying to contact you for a few days, I was starting to be worried. No one has been able to reach you for a time.”<br>“Well, you know I’m busy and I don’t like interruptions, so don’t worry. What do you want?”<br>“Doesn’t matter. Listen, the conductor wants to know about the progress. You know he’s going to retire after this performance and he doesn’t want to do it with a failure.”<br>“He won’t. It’ll be a brilliant success. Everything will be ready for the rehearsals.”<br>“That’s excellent! Thanks Anton. I’ll let him know.”<br>“One more thing, there's something I need from you.”<br>“Of course, what is it?”<br>“I’m going to need one more B flat clarinet. There is a section where I’m working on a floating texture with the woodwinds… Doesn't matter, I just need a third clarinet.”<br>“A floating texture! That’s amazing! Of course, I’ll make sure you have the clarinet. Goodbye Anton.”</p>
      <p>Most of the time, he just ignored the phone or the doorbell and raged for the interruption. They reminded him of the pressure, if for a moment he had forgotten. For hours afterward, he blamed whoever called for every annoyance. Only when his work went well did he forget his anger.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">***</p><p><br></p>
      <p>It was only ten days until the rehearsals, and he had received an uninspiring call from the First Symphonic Orchestra director just to remind him of the deadline and even suggest that they could start a couple of days earlier–which, of course, Anton regarded as impossible. That call might have broken his bubble, but that day it didn’t. Most of the job was done. There were transitions to write and details to polish that would need hard work, but the concerto was already fully conceived. It was going to be a major success.</p>
      <p>The first movement, Allegro con brio. The orchestra rising splendid, awakening a virtuoso piano. Passionate yet elegant. The second movement, Adagio cantabile, a subtle piece where a delicate piano gracefully floated on gentle, sustained woodwinds. The third movement, Vivace energico, a triumphant finale, vibrating and apotheotic, with the piano challenging a powerful brass section. A modern and brilliant concerto, extraordinarily demanding for the soloist–Anton, the composer himself, in the premiere.</p>
      <p>He had done it again. For the first time in months, he would sleep peacefully. He might even take a moment to think about something unrelated to the concerto.</p>
      <p>On the way to bed, he noticed a spot in his perfectly arranged corridor.</p>
      <p>“Ah! It’s just a cockroach.”</p>
      <p>That was unpleasant, but he would get rid of it immediately. In part, it wasn’t that bad. It would be like getting rid of the anger from the interruptions, the fear of not reaching what he demanded of himself, all the struggles.</p>
      <p>He got the poison and rushed back to the corridor, but the cockroach wasn’t there. It was probably hiding somewhere nearby. Of course, he would take care of it before going to sleep. There couldn’t be a cockroach in his home, interruptions on his phone or poor sections in his concerto.</p>
      <p>He closed the doors in the corridor. With little furniture, there were only a few places for the cockroach to hide. He sprayed poison in the small gaps where it might be and stood still, shoe in hand, waiting for the cockroach to flee.</p>
      <p>But that didn’t happen. Maybe it died before it could make its way out. Even so, he needed to be sure, so he started moving the furniture, expecting to find it somewhere.</p>
      <p>A few times, he mistook darker spots in the wood for the cockroach, and struck them with the shoe—only to realize they weren't what he thought. He inspected all the furniture in that room but didn’t find it, alive or dead. Had it escaped the corridor? He couldn’t be sure it was still there.</p>
      <p>It was really late, almost morning. Without realizing it, he had spent the night chasing the cockroach. He finally gave up and blamed himself for the waste of time when such a critical task, his concerto, demanded all of it. Only his exhaustion kept his rage from growing more than it did.</p>
      <p>As he was putting away the poison, his thoughts were suddenly interrupted. There it was! The cockroach rushed under the fridge, and his remorse scurried away too. This time he would be more careful, it wouldn’t escape. Without taking his sight off the fridge, he closed the kitchen door, sealed the gap at the bottom with a rag, and resumed the hunt.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">***</p><p><br></p>
      <p>It had been three days. All over the house, the furniture was moved or turned upside down, the drawers pulled out and scattered. Every door was closed, their bottoms sealed with rugs, and opened only when absolutely necessary. He had barely slept or eaten. He had struck with his shoe every darker spot in the house. Yet an entire day had passed without any sign of the cockroach.</p>
      <p>Once in a while, he considered going back to work. But he couldn’t. First, he had to get rid of the cockroach. The house was completely sealed, so it had to be still there, somewhere. Everything had to be in order for him to work without distractions–the intruder had to be purged. Then, he would finish the concerto with flawless perfection.</p>
      <p>He started feeling more irritated when the phone rang, even though he no longer answered it. Days were passing and he had made no progress on the concerto. Neither with the cockroach. The entire situation felt like poison in his body. A poison that wasn’t meant for him.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">***</p><p><br></p>
      <p>After a few more days, the messages left in his phone had evolved from expressing concern to threatening to cancel the concerto if he didn’t respond. Failure, his worst fear.</p>
      <p>He wouldn’t answer. There was barely enough time to complete the job. Yet, the only thing that mattered was the cockroach. He had to–needed to–find it.</p>
      <p>He had searched the place dozens of times, but a few nooks remained where the cockroach could be. Anton set up his wooden ladder next to a piece of furniture and climbed carefully. He hated the instability of such ladders, but he had no choice.</p>
      <p>Once up, he inspected the top. It was slightly dusty, cleaned less often than more accessible parts. There were a few dark spots in the wood, which weren’t the bug. It wasn’t until he looked more closely that he noticed something else. It was the cockroach–motionless, almost invisible.</p>
      <p>His hand, clutching the deadly shoe, began to tremble. It had been so long. He couldn’t fail this time. He held himself tightly to the ladder, and prepared to squash the cockroach. Without taking his eyes off it, he slowly lifted the shoe, aimed, and struck it with all his strength.</p>
      <p>It was so violent that the ladder bounced back and he fell, hitting his head on the floor. The accident was fatal. Before he definitely died just a moment later, lying there on the floor, unable to move, he still had time to see the cockroach parading in front of him. In his head, the apotheotic and triumphant finale of the third movement of the concerto accompanied the scene. Powerful, brilliant–the piano performance, otherworldly. An amazing ending, no doubt it would unleash a thunderous ovation. As he faded away, he had one last thought:</p>
      <p>"It’s just a cockroach.”</p>
      <h2>The note</h2>
      <p>It was early evening, already night. The plane had just taken off in the middle of a storm. The rain was constant and the wind shook the plane uncomfortably. It made Franz feel sick. He started thinking he wouldn’t be able to play a single note on the piano when he arrived.</p>
      <p>The day before, he had received a note requesting him to perform, indicating only a place, a time, and that he’d see the score there. The order came by urgent mail along with a substantial payment, but there wasn’t any contact information. Who was hiring him? How was he supposed to confirm or decline the job? He tried reaching the auditorium in the note, but no one responded.</p>
      <p>It was strange. Usually he wouldn’t take a request like this seriously. But such a generous payment was hard to ignore. It was worth meeting whoever hired him, for future engagements. However, he had his boundaries and would make it clear this was no way to address a concert pianist like him.</p>
      <p>The turbulence of the plane, along with his thoughts, made him feel nauseous. Unable to handle it, he discreetly grabbed his air sickness bag and vomited into it. A flight attendant noticed and came:</p>
      <p>“Sir, is everything all right?”<br>“Yes, sorry” he replied, wiping his mouth, “I just can’t deal with an unstable flight like this.”<br>“My apologies, sir. The weather conditions are a bit challenging today. Would you like some motion sickness tablets? They might help.”<br>“No, no, please,” he said quickly, “just let me alone. Thank you.”</p>
      <p>At last, the plane landed and he felt relieved. In this city the weather wasn’t that bad. The rain was much lighter and there was no wind. He got a taxi with a talkative driver.</p>
      <p>“To the hotel, then. I can tell you are not from around here. Most people I pick up are just passing through. This place is barely a city. It’s more like a big town.”<br>Franz didn’t join in, so he continued.<br>“A quieter life has its advantages. But of course, there’s not much to do around here. With this weather anyway it’s better to stay indoors. The streets flood and get puddles big enough to shallow your foot. They don’t bother fixing things up anymore. This city has seen better days. If you want some advice, don’t leave the hotel unless you have to.”<br>“Actually, I'm a musician. I perform tonight at the auditorium.”<br>The driver looked at him in the rearview mirror.<br>“At the auditorium?”<br>“Yes” replied Franz, “Tonight”.</p>
      <p>The driver looked back through the mirror again, this time his eyes sharper. There wasn’t more talk for the rest of the ride. Franz found the city was indeed small, calm and silent. There were few people on the streets, even when it was still evening.</p>
      <p>Once in the hotel, he headed to the reception.<br>“I need a room, just for one night.”<br>“Of course. Name?”<br>“Franz.”<br>“Welcome Mr. Franz. Are you staying with us for leisure? If so, you might be interested in one of our city guides.”<br>“Actually I’m a pianist, I came to perform at the auditorium.<br>The receptionist took a second, but didn’t break eye contact.<br>“I’m afraid that’s not possible, sir. The auditorium has been closed for over twenty years.”<br>“That can’t be right. I’m supposed to be performing there tonight.”<br>“There must be some mistake. The place is abandoned. I once heard something about a plan to restore it, but nothing ever came of it.”<br>“But I have a request note right here. It has all the details–the time, the location–and I even received the payment. This doesn’t make sense.”<br>“It seems there’s been some sort of a mix-up.”<br>“I’m sure there is an explanation.”</p>
      <p>As Franz entered his room, he went straight to the phone and tried to contact the auditorium. As before, there was no answer. After three attempts he gave up and decided to take some rest in bed. Although the situation was somewhat uncertain, he had reason to believe he would be performing in a couple of hours.</p>
      <p>After the rest, he had a shower, got dressed for the performance and thoroughly went through his finger warm-up routine on a table, since he didn’t have access to a piano.</p>
      <p>The time to leave arrived. The auditorium was just a half hour walk from the hotel. It wasn’t raining anymore but the streets were still empty, like a ghost town. The silence made his worries louder. From time to time, he glanced at the note in his pocket, as if he could have missed something.</p>
      <p>He arrived at the auditorium. It was completely closed. The main entrance was surrounded by a construction fence that seemed to have been there for a very long time. The paint in the walls was peeling. Small plants grew between the floor tiles. It was clearly abandoned, as he had been told.</p>
      <p>He walked around the building several times looking for another entrance or anyone waiting for him. The time was passing but the place remained deserted. He checked the note again. Time and place were correct. He felt like a fool. What was the point of all of this? Was it a cruelty or a mistake?</p>
      <p>He was disappointed and angry. He had gone through so much for nothing. It was his fault. He had committed to just a lousy note. And he had gone there despite not having been able to confirm, even after having been told that the place was abandoned. He should have anticipated it.</p>
      <p>But his thoughts were interrupted when he turned into a street bordering the auditorium. The sight of a door closing, as if someone had just entered, got his attention back. That street was full of trash containers and was so narrow that it could barely be called a street.</p>
      <p>He approached and found a worn metal door, barely noticeable among the containers. He had missed it before. It wasn’t very welcoming, but it was in the same building. He opened it and looked inside.</p>
      <p>The door led into a long, dim corridor with rusted walls and exposed pipes. No sign of the person who had entered before.</p>
      <p>He went in and advanced cautiously, nothing suggested that he should be there. There were closed doors on both sides, but he didn’t try to open them.</p>
      <p>The end of the corridor was darker, very quiet. It arrived at another door. After some hesitation, he tried it. It opened.</p>
      <p>The door led to the stage of the auditorium. An orchestra stood under the lights, silent and ready to perform. There was no audience and the musicians were focused. The conductor noticed him and pointed to the piano, indicating he should sit there.</p>
      <p>Stunned, he went to sit. There was a score in the stand. He had a quick look at it. It didn’t show a title, but it wasn’t anything he had played or heard before. He couldn’t even guess the composer, although it was clear it was modern, probably contemporary. In some sections the score looked demanding enough that he might need to take a closer look.</p>
      <p>But there wasn’t time. The orchestra started playing and caught him by surprise with the score in his hands. As a reflex he put the score on the stand and just started playing.</p>
      <p>Soon, the unanswered questions faded away. He was completely immersed in the performance, carefully rendering even the subtlest details, being one with the piano.</p>
      <p>The more he played, the more he surrendered at the piece. It was of a unique taste and beautifulness. Elaborated up to the thinnest detail, extremely delicate at times, powerful at others, perfectly balanced. Every single note seemed not to have been possible in any other way.</p>
      <p>Embracing the piece as it came, trusting his body when it was challenging, baring his soul when it was intimate, the pleasure was unlike anything. He lost the notion of time, of himself and of everything.</p>
      <p>As the performance finished, he was ecstatic, almost euphoric. He needed a moment to recompose. He looked around incredulously. The others didn’t seem affected in the same way. He, however, was no longer the same.</p>
      <p>The musicians started leaving in silence through the same door he had entered. He hadn’t noticed during the performance, but a small audience, around a dozen, had gathered there. Although there had been no applause.</p>
      <p>He approached one of the musicians to ask. Not about the strange situation, which he no longer seemed aware of. He just wouldn’t leave without knowing what the piece was. The musician replied:</p>
      <p>“Well, they didn’t have much time to arrange this. The composer was well known in this city, and was recently found dead in his house, in weird circumstances. They also found this piano concerto he had almost finished. Today he’s been buried here, beneath the auditorium, in recognition. When it’s restored, it’ll bear his name. We played the concerto for the close ones, and now we let them finish the farewell.”</p>

      <h1>The little girl</h1>
      <p style="font-family:arial;font-size: 1.0rem">March 3, 2024</p>
      <p>This is the story behind my theme <em>The little girl</em>.</p>
      <p>I often walk or run in the countryside near my place to find peace or get inspired. One morning I was there and witnessed a scene.</p>
      <p>Near the country lane, a horse and a man were farming a field. A car stopped next to them. The rear window opened and a little girl with a pacifier, about one year old, peered out to see the horse. The farmer noticed and approached the car to introduce the horse to her. The girl was amazed. It might be the first time she saw one.</p>
      <p>The scene was delightful, but there was something more. The few other cars on that lane couldn’t pass because it wasn’t wide enough, so they had to wait. And at that time of day they were probably rushing to work. Yet, no one honked or said anything.</p>
      <p>I like to think that we all thought that the moment was worth it. Isn’t the point of our civilization and all the rushing through our duties precisely to allow for this kind of meaningful moments?  What are we rushing into otherwise? These thoughts came with me for the rest of the walk.</p>
      <p>Once at home I sat at the piano and without much thinking <em>The little girl</em> theme happened. Pure and simple.</p>
      <p>And that’s it. You can find the score as part of my <em><a href="scores.html" style="color:black">Little piano pieces</a></em> book. Or just send me an email and I’ll send it to you.</p>
      <br>
      <h1>The journey of Cosmophony</h1>
      <p style="font-family:arial;font-size: 1.0rem">August 17, 2023</p>
      <p>My music is different from time to time, but it all has one thing in common: composing it is a journey for me. This is the story of my album <em><a href="https://victoralamo.bandcamp.com/album/cosmophony" style="color:black">Cosmophony</a></em>.</p>
      <p>It all started after reading a few introductory books on astrophysics. I was very excited about all I had learned and felt inspired to create an album.</p>
      <p>It took me around three months to complete it. Immersed in my studio I lived the many adventures that the music narrates: witnessing the birth of a star, passing by a neutron star (a personal favorite)…</p>
      <p>But this journey would change my life. The unexpected began when I decided that the closing theme would be about the end of the universe. Some research made me realize that chances are humanity won’t be there forever—the universe as we know it will not.</p>
      <p>For me this was relevant. I had always assumed an eternal humanity that would evolve into a wise and virtuous civilization. With every decision I made, big or small, I tried to drive us into becoming this elevated species. This was my North, my purpose.</p>
      <p>However, an ephemeral humanity compromised this grandiose idea of purpose. To me, ephemeral meant meaningless.</p>
      <p>I felt myself floating in a void. The ground I was walking on had never been there. I continued doing everything—early mornings, physical activity...—but I was uninspired. I didn’t see a reason for it.</p>
      <p>It took me time to accept I was not serving a higher purpose and to learn to appreciate a humbler existence. This was a profound transformation.</p>
      <p>It got reflected in the music. I added a theme titled <em>Humanity, existence and meaning</em> to <em>Cosmophony</em>. I removed it later in a revision because it was off topic for anyone but me, but an old version of the album with the theme can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbTkrzSV1hw&t=2192s" style="color:black">here</a>.</p>
      <p>What started just as an exciting reading about the universe eventually transcended into a life changing journey. At the beginning it was scary. Over time, I realized it made me free.</p>
      <br>
      <h1>Inspiration, creative process and spirituality</h1>
      <p style="font-family:arial;font-size: 1.0rem">July 29, 2023</p>
      <p>Most of the time my music is a result of intention and work. But there are times when I’m not as much in control: it comes without asking and it is whatever it wants. At best, my creative process is not entirely conscious.</p>
      <p>Here’s one way in which my music “happens” on its own.</p>
      <p>Whenever I’m feeling in some way, I sit at the piano to try to balance myself. I don’t know what keys I should press to find that balance, but I have a sense of “like this” and “not like this” as my fingers flow through different things. The piano becomes my blind person’s cane to figure out myself.</p>
      <p>From the things that are “like this”, a piece of music emerges. Once there, I may see what triggered it: that walk on that cloudy day, that friendly cat I met in the park, that conversation… And the music tells why. The cloudy walk was solitude. The friendly cat was gratitude. The conversation was connection. I wouldn’t know any of this when I sat at the piano.</p>
      <p>It’s fascinating. My inner self is days ahead of me, and we communicate through music. This form of creative process reflects, but also is, a spiritual walk.</p>
